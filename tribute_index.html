        <!-- biography -->
        <p>
            Judy Tyrer has been in the computer industry since almost it's inception. With over 30years of experience
            in
            the tech industry, she is one of the many pioneers proving that it wasn't just for the boys. Having
            experienced
            the times where women were not traditionally part of the workforce, she had quite the hill to climb. And
            when
            she had climbed one, she went to go climb another moving into the world of Game Development.

                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    After graduating from SMU with a double major in English Literature and
                    Secondary Education, Judy started in the Serious Games Business at Control Data
                    Corporation where she had the unique privilege of working on PLATO, a computer
                    based education system.From there Judy moved into the computer industry working on distributed UNIX
                    operating systems, specializing in File Systems. During this time she served on the
                    File System Committee for the Open Software Consortium and published a
                    USENET paper on "Adding Tightly Consistent Replication to OSF's DFS".
                </p>
                <img class="img-thumbnail float-right" src="./tribute_assets/Judy_young.jpg" alt="Judy's Acting Headshot">
                <p>
                    Even with difficulties of being the bread-winner of her household as well as being a woman in a
                    male
                    dominated
                    career, Judy never gave up on her other passions. For a short time she pursued limited acting
                    roles,
                    landing a
                    supporting role in the independent film Alcatraz Avenue. Then as the tech industry reeled from
                    exporting of
                    jobs overseas, Judy took her English degree and became a middleschool teacher in Southern
                    California.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally though, after raising two kids, a divorce, and looking to try something new, Judy decided
                    to go
                    back to
                    her game
                    playing robot fantasies from when she was 9. It was here she joined the game industry working at
                    Ubisoft on the
                    Ghost Recon series as a networking engineer and multi-player engine specialist.
                    From Ubisoft, Judy moved to Sony Online Entertainment as Lead Engineer for
                    Magic the Gathering: Tactics. She was then tapped by Linden Labs as Senior
                    Engineering Manager of the Engine Room, the team responsible for server related
                    software and simulations for Second Life.
